<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Second Realm</h2>
<p><b>Purgatory,</b> or <b>The Other Place,</b> is the second realm of the Madness Combat Infernolly lore. Purgatory is a supermassive mountain of cleansing and purification. The goal of Purgatory is to cleanse souls of their sins and permit them into Heaven.</p>
<p>There are nine layers to the mountain, each having its specific punishment. Once reaching Eden, the highest layer, Shades will wait to be transported to Heaven. Rumors speculate that Eden is now a town due to the disappearance of an angel.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h3>Layer 0</h3>
  <p>Cruelty is one of the lowest layers of <b>Purgatory,</b> no one knows what lies beneath. Souls are placed in a dark red hellscape where they fight their worst fears. Every injury cuts a part of their physical body, and they will be consumed by Purgatory and morphed into <b>Shades.</b></p>
  <p><b>Punishment:</b> The environment is purely based on life experiences, you cannot spot other individuals in this layer as it is a personalized hell. </p>
  <p><b>Danger Level:</b> High</p>

<button class="accordion"; style="color: #FFDF6E"; >PRIDE</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Pride is the first layer of Purgatory Proper. It is a large plane of boulders and marble rock with a shiny gold color inside. Due to the invention of a Demon Deterrent System (DDS), a city has emerged in the center, where a small group of people hold power over others. </p>
  <p>Punishment: Due to the presence of demons, souls must carry heavy marble rocks uphill to where they can cut them up or carve them into statues. A lot of the architecture of the other layers comes from Pride.</p>
  <p>Danger Level: Low</p>

  <p>Some shades were spotted harming other souls using canes made out of stalagmite. After stealing the cane, they then proceeded to use it as a blind cane, proving to us researchers how much the sin of Envy affects people.</p>
  <p><b>Punishment:</b> Those in Envy are punished by having most of the water taken away from them. Upon reaching for a pool of water, it disappears in their hands, punishing them for their envy. </p>
